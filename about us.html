    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Lindiwe Bomseni was the one who took this salon from nothing to something big. She started this salon in 2020. She started as a street vendor until she found a salon.
        She keeps on improving her salon. She started alone and named the salon "Kindzo Hairstylist". She started with only 1 client until
        she got 20 clients. In 2022, she started hiring people and taught them how to do braids, nails, and haircuts.
        This year 2024, she bought a huge place where she can do salon without paying rent. So in January, she opened a school called Lindzo School.
